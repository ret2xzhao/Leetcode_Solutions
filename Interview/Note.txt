# 1. Write a Linux shell command to redirect the stdout of command "cat abx.txt" to "stdout.txt" and stderr to "stderr.txt"
#    cat abx.txt 2>stderr.txt |tee stdout.txt
#    tee: read from standard input and write to standard output and files.
#
# 2. Write a Linux shell command to count the number of files with extension ".c" in current folder and its sub-folders.
#    find ./ -type f -name "*.c" |wc -l
#    -./:     current directory
#    -type f: regular file
#    -name:   pattern
#
#    wc: print newline, word, and byte counts for each file.
#    -l: print the newline counts
#    -c: print the byte counts
#
# 3. Write a script in shell, python, or any other language that 1.reads a string from stdin as input, 2.counts the number of spaces(blank characters) in the input
#    string, and prints out the count.
#    #!/bin/sh
#
#    read string
#    echo "$string" |tr -cd " \t"| wc -c
#
## get input from user
#
#inputString = input("Enter a string:")
#
#count = 0
#for i in inputString:
#    if i==" ":
#        count=count+1
#
#print("The number of spaces: ", count)
#
# 4. Write a Linux shell command to find out the top 5 memory usage processes, print out the parent process id, process id, and command string.
#    ps -eo ppid,pid,cmd, --sort=-%mem |head -6
#
# 5. Write a Linux shell command to terminate all the processes with "needstop" string in command line.
#    pkill -f 'needstop'
#
# 6. Please configure the interface "eth0" of local Linux PC with IP 192.168.0.99/24, set up the default route on gateway 192.168.0.3, DNS server as 8.8.8.8 .
#    Set IP address:
#    ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.99 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
#    Set default route on gateway:
#    route add default gw 192.168.0.3
#    Set DNS server:
#    echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf
#    resolv.conf -resolver configuration file
